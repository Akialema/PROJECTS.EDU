### 0️⃣ [Project-0. Auto-guessing a random num.](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/Project-0%3AGame_Guess_number_auto)

The project was actually supposed to be called 'Guess the Number Game,' but...

Here is an algorithm, as implied by the name, that randomly selects a number and attempts to guess it within N tries. In other words, two `np.random.randint()` functions try to become friends with each other.))
