### [Gift store customers segmentation](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/gift_store_customers_segmentation)

Clustering, dimensionality reduction, training of logistic and tree models workout. + RFM analysis.

### [New York taxi trip duration prediction](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/taxi_trip_duration)

Training in building regression models using the example of the kaggle competition: predicting the duration of a taxi ride in New York.

### [Forecasting bank deposit open](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/forecasting_bank_deposit_open)

An example of solving a classification problem to predict whether a client will open a deposit or not. 

### [Booking reviewer score prediction](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/booking_reviewer_score_prediction)

Here you can find my attempt to predict user ratings of hotels on the Booking.com website.

### [HH jobs SQL analysis](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/hh_sql_jobs_analysis)

The project is aimed at training the skill of interacting with a PostgreSQL database using the example of the HeadHunter job vacancy database.

### [HH database analysis](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/headhunter_jobs_analysis)

This project is about... basic table transformation, feature preprocessing for further analysis, primary graphs and preliminary data cleansing.

### [Australian rain prediction](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/australian_rain_prediction)

The project is a training exercise in applying logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms, using hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search to solve a binary classification problem on a dataset containing weather indicators in Australia over a certain period of time.

### [Bank clients segmentation](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/bank_clients_segmentation)

The project is a training exercise in applying clustering algorithms such as KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering to solve the task of segmenting clients of a New York bank for a more personalized approach in the marketing department's work.

### [Flight satisfaction prediction](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/flight_satisfaction_prediction)

The project is a training exercise in applying various boosting algorithms, using hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search to solve a binary classification problem on a dataset containing various flight characteristics.

### [Forecasting wells gas production](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/forecasting_wells_gas_production)

The project is an implementation of a predictive linear model based on data about gas fields belonging to a fictional individual.

### [Gender identification by voice](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/gender_identification_by_voice)

The project focuses on developing a machine learning model for automatic classification of people’s gender based on voice data. The goal is to determine whether the speaker is male or female using audio recordings, which can be applied in speech recognition systems, security, and service personalization.

### [HR agency data research](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/hr_agency_data_research)

The project focuses on analyzing the job market in the field of Data Science based on salary data from 2020 to 2022. Its goal is to identify key trends, such as salary dynamics, the impact of geography, work experience, job position, and other factors on compensation levels. The results will help the HR agency better understand the market and provide more relevant recommendations to companies and job seekers.

### [Health insurance prediction](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/insurance_forecast_by_using_linear_regression)

The project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate individual medical expenses covered by insurance companies based on the characteristics of the insured individuals. It uses the popular Medical Cost Personal Datasets, which includes features such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, region of residence, and insurance charges.

The goal of the project is to identify the most influential factors affecting medical insurance costs and to learn how to predict these expenses using machine learning models.

### [Mall customers segmentation](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/mall_customers_segmentation)

The project aims to segment shopping mall customers into groups based on socio-demographic and behavioral data like age, gender, income, and spending score. This helps the client understand customer types and make informed decisions on store openings, services, and marketing strategies. 

### [Online shoppers purchasing prediction](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/online_shoppers_purchasing_prediction)

The project focuses on building a model to predict whether a user will make a purchase during their session on an online store’s website. This will help better understand visitor behavior and improve the effectiveness of online marketing.

### [Outflow bank customers forecasting](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/outflow_bank_customers_forecasting)

The project focuses on building a classification model to predict customer churn for a bank. The bank aims to develop a loyalty campaign and retain its clients, so it is essential to identify those who are likely to leave in the near future. The task involves creating a model that can predict churn probabilities, evaluating the model’s performance, and interpreting the results to support data-driven decisions for improving customer retention.

### [Spam or not spam classification](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/spam_or_not_classification)

The name speaks for itself.

### [Teenagers interests segmentation](https://github.com/Akialema/PROJECTS.EDU/tree/main/teenagers_interests_segmentation)

The project focuses on analyzing and segmenting teenagers’ interests based on data about their behavior, preferences, and activities. The goal is to identify groups with similar interests to better understand the audience, which will help in developing targeted marketing strategies, educational programs, or social initiatives.
